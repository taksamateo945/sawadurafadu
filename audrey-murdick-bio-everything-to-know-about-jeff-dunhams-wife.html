She was born on the 29th day of August 1980 in Norco, a city in Riverside County, California, in the United States. It was also here that she grew up with her family.</p><p>Audrey was born to a father identified as Steve Murdick and a mother called Sally Murdick. Her father worked as a Programmer Analyst with a company called Northrop Grumman for more than 30 years before retiring. Her mother, on the other hand, worked as an elementary school teacher who was fluent in English, Spanish, French, and German. Interestingly, both her parents were very physically active and took part in sports.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Audrey-Murdick1.jpg><h3><strong>Her Love for Fitness and Bodybuilding Came From Her Parents</strong></h3><p>Her father was a runner in his youthful days but stopped running for some time as he tried to provide for his family. However, after he retired, he returned to running and even trained to run competitively. The man trained for and completed a handful of 10k’s and half marathons, and six full marathons. Interestingly, Steve Murdick actually ran the very first of those full marathons two weeks after his 60th birthday.</p><p>Audrey’s mother is also an active woman. She also used to run in her youthful days but slowed down after the kids began to come. However, many years later after she retired from working, Sally Murdick challenged herself and actually became a brown belt in karate and also began to take part in fitness contests. She trained and dieted for a whole year in order to compete in her very first fitness competition when she was 58 years old.</p><p>Sally Murdick has also earned some certifications in both massage therapy and fitness training and has run a couple of half marathons and one full marathon. It is clear that Audrey Murdick got her love for fitness and bodybuilding from her parents. She is very fond of her parents and has spoken of them very glowingly several times before.</p><h3><strong>Audrey Has Two Siblings</strong></h3><p>Audrey Murdick is not an only child. The fitness guru actually has two brothers she grew up with. Her brothers are identified as Tim Murdick and Nick Audrey and she is the youngest child.

The bond that they share was firmly formed since their days as little kids. According to Audrey, when she was little, she and her brothers were very fond of each other and they were protective of her as she was the only girl.</p><p>She also revealed that their parents helped them become close by making sure that every birthday and holiday was a big celebration in their home. Because of this, Audrey and her siblings always looked forward to each and every special occasion on the calendar.</p><p>Also, every June, her parents made sure that they would leave town and embark on a family vacation to other cities and witness new things. She revealed that many of these vacations were actually road trips to different national parks and other such places. They also traveled to Mexico and Hawaii to see different sights. These and many more activities in her childhood days made Audrey and her siblings bond very well and become very close to their parents.</p><h3><strong>Audrey Murdick Battled Weight Gain as a Child</strong></h3><p>Audrey Murdick battled weight gain as a child. The nutritionist explains that <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">she has always loved food</a> and especially loved eating food so much when she was a child.

Her weight gain would eventually ignite her passion for fitness, dieting, and bodybuilding.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/audrey-Murdick2.jpg><h2><strong>Audrey Murdick’s Amazing Fitness Journey</strong></h2><p>Because she was obese as a little girl who absolutely loved food, Audrey Murdick decided to do something about her body when she turned a teenager.
