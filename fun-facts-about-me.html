It could be a job interview; it could be a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>first date</a>. It could be a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>dinner party</a> or just a way to end an awkward silence. In any case, for certain social interactions, it's best to have a little something personal in your back pocket. Because, really, the only thing worse than being caught off-guard is coming across as boring. So, to help you avoid such a slanderous claim, we've put together 102 examples of "<strong>fun facts about me</strong>" to use in any number of scenarios.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>140 Conversation Starters to Help Beat Any Awkward Silence</a>.</strong></p><h2><strong>Why Are Fun Facts Such Great Ice Breakers?</strong></h2><p>Not only does sharing a few fun facts about yourself help expedite the "getting to know you" process, but it also helps set boundaries and expectations for the conversation to follow. This kind of interaction also falls under the umbrella of <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>social learning</a>, a behavioral theory that holds that new behaviors can be learned by observing, imitating, and modeling after others.</p><p>In the workplace, this model is thought to help employees gain new skills they haven't been formally trained on. It's also a way to pool together everyone's talents. During more personal encounters, it can help people more quickly adopt the social norms needed for a successful exchange. And that's something that proves especially important during your first time meeting someone new.</p><h2><strong>Three Quick Tips for Choosing Fun Facts About Yourself</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/06/fun-facts-about-me.-tips.jpg><h3><strong>Keep it clean</strong></h3><p>If you're in a position where you feel the need to offer up fun, interesting facts about yourself, then it's safe to say you're not hanging around with people you know very well. First introductions are always a little awkward, don't make things even weirder by going beyond what your conversation partner is comfortable discussing.</p><h3><strong>Be relatable</strong></h3><p>Showing up with a fun fact about yourself is a great way to disclose a little more information about your personal life, but you don't want to dominate the exchange. Stick to disclosures that allow for a little back and forth.</p><h3><strong>Keep it brief</strong></h3><p>Brevity is also important to factor in here. While we're sure every fun fact about you is backed by an even more interesting story, it's important to know when to cut things off. Give everyone else a chance to share something and wrap it up before your audience starts getting bored.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>200+ Get to Know You
