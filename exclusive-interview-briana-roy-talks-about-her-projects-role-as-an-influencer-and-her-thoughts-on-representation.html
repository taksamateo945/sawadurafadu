Check out the interview below:</p><h4 class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>Can you please tell our readers about your journey as an actor and a model?</span></h4><p class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>I started modeling in my hometown Miami at the age of seven doing print ads for companies such as Advis Budget, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Old Navy, Target and many more.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>Then I transitioned into the acting industry when I landed my first lead role as “Nina” in the movie&nbsp;RECLAIM which I play alongside veteran actors including John Cusack, Ryan Phillippe, Rachelle Lefevre, Luis Guzmán & Two Time Oscar Nominee Jacki Weaver. The film was distributed by Lionsgate and then got picked up by Netflix.</span></p><p class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>As I’m growing and working in the acting industry, I joined the Union: SAG (Screen Actors Guild) / member of the Union for the entertainers. In the meantime, I still do modeling such as runways, print ads and yes this has been a beautiful journey for me so far.&nbsp;</span></p><h4 class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>What triggered your interest in the creative field and what part of the creative process do you enjoy the most?</span></h4><p class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>I want to be an inspiration to others, someone they can look up to. I like the fact that I get to portray different characters with different backgrounds that can relate to a lot of different people and that the audience can enjoy!</span></p><h4 class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1>As an actor, what vision do you hold towards your art?</h4><p class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>As an actor I vision myself doing a little bit of everything such as Drama, Comedy, Horror and also, I would love to have my own show and continue to work alongside veteran actors whom I can get more experience and tips from.&nbsp;</span></p><h4 class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>Who do you look up to for inspiration?</span></h4><p class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>I would say for inspiration I look up to so many amazing people in the entertainment industry: Oprah Winfrey, Ellen Degeneres, Taraji P. Henson, Viola Davis, Emma Stone, Denzel Washington, Emily Blunt and many more.&nbsp;</span></p><h4 class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>In your journey as an actor and a model, what has been the best piece of advice/significant lesson that you might have received?</span></h4><p class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>I’m very grateful for all the opportunities that have been given to me so far but out of all the advice and tips I received from all the amazing veteran actors I have worked with it has the be “The best way to play a character is to play an exaggeration of yourself”. I received this piece of advice from the great John Cusack himself while we were filming.&nbsp;</span></p><h4 class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>There has always been an apprehension amongst people towards modeling. We have seen your interviews wherein you have explained how you use the platform for representation and positivity. Can you please elaborate a bit on it?</span></h4><p class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>Whenever I’m being interviewed I like to explain that not only I use my social media to spread my content and my brand but I like to use that as a platform where I can spread positivity across my platform to other people. I constantly receive messages from people asking me for advice whether it’s about natural hair, how to pursue your dreams, individuality, confidence and so much more. I always like to take my time and talk to my fans and my audience about whatever was asked. I also like to talk about expressing yourself through your culture because I am a Proud afro carrier and I always like to give advice on wearing your natural hair and just owning it!&nbsp;</span></p><h4 class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>How has been the experience as a model? Do you have a dream fashion show that you would like to attend/walk on in the near future?</span></h4><p class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>I have always been a person who enjoys fashion. Being a part of that type of industry you meet a lot of people from photographers, designers, magazine editors, and many others. They’re so many amazing designers that I would love to have the opportunity to work with but there is one, in particular, that would be such a blessing to do which is Chanel. I love the whole imagery of Chanel because it is such simple, chic, posh & fabulous couture that I would definitely wear everything which still has that “I slay and I’m fabulous feeling”.&nbsp;</span></p><h4 class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>The issue of representation and diversity in the mainstream industry has become quite significant. As an actor, how do you see the evolution of the industry on these aspects?</span></h4><p class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>I think something that is really important is to have an example, someone who you can look up to as a role model or a public figure. I think there are some amazing black female actresses that are changing the game such as Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, Viola Davis, Regina King.</span></p><h4 class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>What steps can we take to encourage diversity and justified representation in the mainstream media and film industry?</span></h4><p class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>I see that there is a lot of black representation on television that we can enjoy and we can all support. I think something that we can definitely encourage is to see different types of black representation from everywhere where it shows the different obstacles and how we overcome them.&nbsp;</span></p><h4 class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>The list of projects that you have undertaken is really impressive. Which project or role has been the most memorable?</span></h4><p class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>Thank you very much! I have enjoyed playing each role that has been given to me and it has been a huge blessing and I believe there more to come but one of the most memorable for me is when I worked alongside Usher in his music video (CRUSH). Meeting him and working alongside was very cool because he is such a humble and a great person.</span></p><h4 class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>Which role has been the most challenging?</span></h4><p class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>I have to say the most challenging role for has to be the role I played which is Nina in the movie (RECLAIM), being involved in a project that had such a strong message about something that happens every day which is child trafficking. The whole purpose of the film was to reach out to the audience and tell a story about how this is something that happens daily.</span></p><h4 class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>Can you please tell our readers about your role as Kendra in “Elle Twelve” (The Soci Circle)?</span></h4><p class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>My role as Kendra in the upcoming Web series (THE SOCI CIRCLE) was very fun for me to play in. I love working on projects that have a great message and this one has a message on what Teen & Tween girls are going through on the daily basis whether it’s bullying, shamming, negativity on social media. It’s a project where it could spread some positivity and be relatable to different people.&nbsp;</span></p><h4 class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>“That’s So Raven” is engraved in the hearts of people born in the 20th century. How was the experience of working alongside Raven?</span></h4><p class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>Raven is so funny & she is very professional. Working alongside her gave me some extra tips on how to be and stay yourself whether you are performing or with a friend on a random day. The whole experience on “Raven’s Home “ was fun and such a blessing.</span></p><p></p><h4 class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>Your social media feed is inspiring. How do perceive the role of social media in the 21st century?</span></h4><p class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>Being involved in social media is one thing. You need to know who your audiences are and how to connect with them and stay connected in a positive way is very important. I’m not going to lie; nowadays having a huge social media presence counts a lot. Therefore, it’s up to you to really use your social media platform to spread positivity, encouragement, and motivation.</span></p><h4 class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>Would you like to share with your future projects or endeavors?</span></h4><p class=m_-1017979789222428361x_p1><span class=m_-1017979789222428361x_s1>Uhm my future projects … yeah, I will be shooting something cool with Brat during the summer. Also, I have a web series that’s going to come out soon, it’s called “Soci Circle” in which I play the role of Kendra.</span></p><p>You can keep yourself updated with Kendra’s projects by following her on <a href=#>Instagram</a> and <a href=#>Twitter</a>.</p><p><strong>Follow @CelebMix on Twitter to keep yourself updated with the latest celebrity news, features, and interviews!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ksrmvy66qoq6VYravwMSrraKdp2Kvs7XAp5hmqp%2BuerWty6SqZpmSpMK1eceeqWaooqS3pq%2FTrGSrp5yaeqK%2FjJqlZqGem7m2sc2cnKtlkaOxbrTEq2StoJ%2BqtKnA0mamp2Wimr2zsdKepa2ZpJ68r3s%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fexclusive-interview-briana-roy-talks-about-her-projects-role-as-an-influencer-and-her-thoughts-on-representation.html&text=Exclusive%20Interview%3a%20Briana%20Roy%20talks%20about%20her%20projects%2c%20role%20as%20an%20influencer%2c%20and%20her%20thoughts%20on&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fexclusive-interview-briana-roy-talks-about-her-projects-role-as-an-influencer-and-her-thoughts-on-representation.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fexclusive-interview-briana-roy-talks-about-her-projects-role-as-an-influencer-and-her-thoughts-on-representation.html&title=Exclusive%20Interview%3a%20Briana%20Roy%20talks%20about%20her%20projects%2c%20role%20as%20an%20influencer%2c%20and%20her%20thoughts%20on" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fexclusive-interview-briana-roy-talks-about-her-projects-role-as-an-influencer-and-her-thoughts-on-representation.html&title=Exclusive%20Interview%3a%20Briana%20Roy%20talks%20about%20her%20projects%2c%20role%20as%20an%20influencer%2c%20and%20her%20thoughts%20on" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fexclusive-interview-briana-roy-talks-about-her-projects-role-as-an-influencer-and-her-thoughts-on-representation.html&title=Exclusive%20Interview%3a%20Briana%20Roy%20talks%20about%20her%20projects%2c%20role%20as%20an%20influencer%2c%20and%20her%20thoughts%20on" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fexclusive-interview-briana-roy-talks-about-her-projects-role-as-an-influencer-and-her-thoughts-on-representation.html&description=Exclusive%20Interview%3a%20Briana%20Roy%20talks%20about%20her%20projects%2c%20role%20as%20an%20influencer%2c%20and%20her%20thoughts%20on" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sharp-tool-that-appropriately-rhymes-with-whacks-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sharp tool that appropriately rhymes with whacks">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./fruit-of-the-underwear-brand-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fruit of the ___ (underwear brand)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
