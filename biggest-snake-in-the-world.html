Some may use length, some may use weight, and some may use both.</p><p>However, most experts agree that the two main contenders for the title of the world’s largest snake are the reticulated python and the green anaconda.</p><p>The reticulated python (Malayopython reticulatus) is widely considered to be the longest snake in the world, according to the Natural History Museum.</p><p>On average, this snake reaches approximately 6.25 meters, or 20.5 feet, in length.</p><p>The longest recorded reticulated python was discovered in 1912 and measured 10 meters, or about 32.8 feet, long.</p><p>However, this measurement has been disputed by some experts who claim that it was exaggerated or inaccurate.</p><p>The green anaconda (Eunectes murinus) is widely considered to be the heaviest snake in the world, according to National Geographic.</p><p>On average, this snake weighs about 227 kilograms or 550 pounds.</p><p>The heaviest recorded green anaconda was captured in 1944 and weighed 215 kilograms or 473 pounds.</p><p>However, this weight has also been challenged by some experts who claim that it was overestimated or inaccurate.</p><p>Both snakes are non-venomous constrictors that kill their prey by wrapping their bodies around them and squeezing them until they suffocate.</p><p>They can swallow large animals such as deer, pigs, crocodiles, and even humans.</p><p>They are found in tropical regions of Asia and South America, respectively.</p><h2><span id=Which_is_bigger_anaconda_or_python>Which is bigger anaconda or python?</span></h2><p>The answer to this question depends on how you define “bigger”.</p><p>If you mean longer, then the python is bigger than the anaconda.</p><p>If you mean heavier, then the anaconda is bigger than the python.</p><p>You mean both length and weight combined, then it is hard to say which one is bigger, as there is no reliable way to compare them.</p><p>One of the reasons why it is difficult to compare the size of these snakes is that they are rarely measured accurately or scientifically.</p><p>Most of the records are based on anecdotal reports or unverified claims that may be exaggerated or inaccurate.</p><p>Moreover, snakes can vary in size depending on their age, sex, diet, habitat, season, and health condition.</p><p>Therefore, it is possible that there are larger specimens of both species that have not been recorded or discovered yet.</p><p>Another reason why it is hard to compare the size of these snakes is that they have different body shapes and proportions.</p><p>Pythons have longer and thinner bodies than anacondas, which have shorter and thicker bodies.</p><p>Pythons also have more vertebrae than anacondas, which means they can stretch more when measured.</p><p>Anacondas have more muscle mass than pythons, which means they can weigh more when measured.</p><p>Therefore, a python may appear longer than an anaconda when stretched out, but an anaconda may appear heavier than a python when coiled up.</p><h2><span id=How_to_find_the_biggest_snake_in_the_world>How to find the biggest snake in the world</span></h2><p>If you still want to <a href=#>find the biggest snake in the world</a> after reading this article, you should be prepared for a challenging and dangerous quest.</p><p>You will need a lot of time, money, equipment, expertise, and luck to locate and measure these elusive and powerful creatures.</p><p>First of all, you will need to decide which species you want to look for: the reticulated python or the green anaconda.</p><p>Then you will need to travel to their respective habitats: Southeast Asia or South America.</p><p>You will need to hire local guides who know the terrain and wildlife well.</p><p>You will also need to obtain permits from authorities who regulate wildlife conservation and research.</p><p>Next, you will need to search for signs of these snakes’ presence: tracks, trails, sheds skins, feces, etc.</p><p>You will also need to look for potential prey items: mammals, birds, reptiles, etc.</p><p>You will need to use various methods of detection: cameras traps</p><p>If you found this
