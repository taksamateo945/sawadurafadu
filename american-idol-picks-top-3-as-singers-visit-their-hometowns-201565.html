American Idol Top 4 week took the remaining singers back to their hometowns for the traditional parade and concert, where there were a surprisingly few number of tears. <strong>Clark Beckham</strong>, <strong>Nick Fradiani</strong>, <strong>Jax</strong>, and <strong>Rayvon Owen</strong> also tackled songs chosen for them by mentor <strong>Scott Borchetta</strong> and ones picked by the judges in a solid night of performances.</p><p>Since Idol moved to one night a week, the eliminations have taken place at various points throughout the episode. While<strong> Tyanna Jones</strong> was awkwardly sent home in fifth place halfway through last week’s show, this week all four performers were able to sing all three songs before the elimination at the end of the night. That means three Idol hopefuls are left heading in to the finale, and one person will have to go home before the two remaining singers face off in the two-night event.</p><p>Read on to find out which three contestants are left vying for the American Idol title!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><strong>Scott Borchetta’s Picks</strong></p><p>The music mogul runs Big Machine Records and is the person who discovered <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>, but he picked mostly older songs for the Idols to sing. Owen started off the show with Borchetta’s most current choice — “Want to Want Me” by <strong>Jason Derulo</strong> — followed by Beckham, Fradiani, and Jax with oldies but goodies. Beckham tousled his hair for a rendition of U2’s “Beautiful Day,” Fradiani took on <strong>Bruce Springsteen</strong>‘s version of “Because the Night,” and Jax covered herself in Union Jack gear for The Who’s “My Generation.” <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a> declared Jax the winner of the round.</p><p><strong>Hometown Visits</strong></p><p>Typically each parade down the contestant’s hometown main street is filled with tears — from the singer, from their parents, from excited fans — but this year, only a few eyes welled up. Beckham’s dad adorably got misty-eyed as he rode in the Ford convertible next to his son, and Jax couldn’t hold in her excitement and gratitude as she was greeted by an adoring New Jersey crowd. But for the most part, everyone kept it together (though they were all gracious and thankful).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Fradiani returned to Guilford, Connecticut to eat a delicious-looking Italian feast with his family, try the ice cream a local shop named after him, and sing with his dad on the town green. Back in the studio, he tackled <strong>Andy Grammar</strong>‘s “Back Home.”</p><p>Tennessee native Beckham hit up the Nashville street corner where he used to busk, then headed to his small hometown and sang with his college choir. His hometown pick was “Sittin’ on the Dock of the Bay” by <strong>Otis Redding</strong>, and it sounded just like you’d expect (soulful, a little screechy, but solid).</p><p>Richmond native Owen was welcomed back to a rainy Virginia day by friends, family, fellow residents, and even a former Idol — Richmond’s own <strong>Elliott Yamin</strong>, who finished in fifth place on season 5. Back in L.A., the soulful singer tackled “As” by <strong>Stevie Wonder</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Jersey girl Jax shed some tears heading back to visit her old school — since she’s 18, it hasn’t been that long since she went there — and had by far the biggest turnout for her hometown concert. Her hometown song was a stripped-down, restrained version of “My Immortal” by Evanescence.</p><p><strong>Keith Urban</strong> gave round 2 to Owen.</p><p><strong>Judges’ Choice</strong></p><p>The choices by Lopez, Urban, and <strong>Harry Connick, Jr.</strong> were, like Borchetta’s, mostly older tracks. They had a suit-clad Beckham attempt the sexy 50 Shades of Grey soundtrack standout “Earned It” by The Weekend, but the other three singers went with older tunes. Owen crooned <strong>Joe Cocker</strong>‘s “You Are So Beautiful,” while Jax tried her hand at Paramore’s “Misery Business” and Fradiani went vintage Idol with a take on “I’ll Be” by <strong>Edwin McCain</strong>. The judges all declared Fradiani the winner of round 3.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Despite the solid performances, though, someone had to go home — and unfortunately, after winning the Twitter save every week it was in play, it was finally time for Owen to say goodbye. The 23-year-old seemed in good spirits as he watched a video package of his biggest Idol moments.</p><p>The American Idol season 14 finale airs Tuesday, May 12 at 9 p.m. ET and Wednesday, May 13 at 8 p.m. ET on Fox.</p><p>Tell <strong>Us</strong>: Did the right singers make the top 3?
