She has amassed a stunning <strong>net worth</strong> of $85 million under her name!</p><p>During the peak of her career, Meg was the director’s favorite to portray the leading lady in various rom-com movies. At that time, the actress reportedly made $10 to $15 million for every box-office hit she starred in, making Meg the highest-paid actress in the world!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Much Does Meg Ryan Earn?</h2><p>During the peak of her career, Meg Ryan was known as the highest-paid actress in history. She received $5 million for her appearance in the drama I.Q. Three years later, she earned $8.5 million and $10.5 million for her roles in City of Angels, and You’ve Got Mail, respectively. As of 1998, she managed to earn $19 million from her acting career!</p><p class=related-post>Read Also: <a href=#>What is Tyler, the Creator’s Net Worth in 2023</a></p><p>While her career in the 2000s suffered a downturn, Meg still received quite hefty paychecks. She earned $15 million each for her roles in Proof of Life and Kate & Leopold. From 1994 to 2002, Meg made more than $60 million from her movies!</p><p>With his jaw-dropping wealth, Meg Ryan never forgets to give back to the community.

She once admitted that her motivation to pursue acting was to earn extra money while completing her education.</p><p>Alas, following her major success as one of the main characters in As the World Turns, Meg was forced to drop out of college only a semester before she graduated. Meg later starred in Top Gun and later in Innerspace. In the latter, she met with her future husband, Dennis Quaid.</p><p>Meg scored her first role as the main character in the 1989 rom-com movie When Harry Met Sally… The role also earned Meg her first Golden Globe nomination. She later starred alongside Tom Hanks in the box-office hit Sleepless in Seattle.</p><p class=related-post>Also Read: <a href=#>What is Harry Styles Net Worth in 2023</a></p><p>In 1994, Meg Ryan portrayed an alcoholic high-school counselor in When a Man Loves a Woman, which surprised many, considering that she was known for her roles in rom-com movies. However, her acting received numerous praises, with <a href=# rel=noopener>critics claiming</a> it was “a first-class production.”&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the continuous success throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Meg’s career suffered a downturn in the 2000s. Almost all the movies she starred in flopped, and her highest-grossing movie during that period was Kate & Leopold, with $70 million worldwide.</p><p>Meg later went on a three-year hiatus before returning to acting in the 2007 independent movie In the Land of Women alongside Kristen Stewart and Adam Brody. Although the movie received mixed reviews, her performance was praised, and the film was dubbed “the best work” Meg has ever done.</p><p>She debuted in movie directing with Ithaca, an adaptation of the 1943 novel The Human Comedy. Meg is currently working on the production of What Happens Later, which she will also star in.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How Many Houses Does Meg Ryan Own?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/creeto.com/wp-content/uploads/Meg-Ryan-mansion-in-Chappaquiddick-Island.jpg><p>Like her filmography, Meg Ryan’s real estate portfolio is extensive! Shortly before <a href=#>her divorce from Dennis Quaid</a>, Meg purchased a stunning <a href=# rel=noopener>Bel-Air estate</a> from movie director Stan Dragoti in 2000. For this 9,000-square-foot property, Meg spent $8.5 million! She resided in this mansion for over a decade before selling it in 2012 for $18.5 million.</p><p>In 2006, Meg purchased a 6,600-square feet mansion in Chappaquiddick Island, Massachusetts, which became her next primary residence. She dished out $9.125 million on the property before selling it in 2019 for $11 million.</p><p>She purchased a luxurious loft in New York City for $8 million in 2014. The loft sports a 4,100-square-foot living space which she renovated to match her personality. Meg eventually sold the property in 2016 for $9.85 million.</p><p>In 2020, the actress spent $5.025 million on a farmhouse in Montecito. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Architectural Digest</a>, the property boasts a 4,200-square-foot living space. However, Meg didn’t live at this house for too long, as she sold the house for $13.3 million nearly two years later.</p><p class=related-post>See Also: <a href=#>Lauren London’s Net Worth Is More Than You Think</a></p><p>She later purchased a larger estate nearby with a 6,200-square-foot living space for $9.5 million.

It was also during that period that she released <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">an audiobook</a>! The actress narrated The Human Comedy by William Saroyan, the novel she would later adapt into a movie in 2015.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How Many Roles Did Meg Ryan Turn Down?</h3><p>For a celebrated actress like Meg Ryan, you can’t blame her for being picky about the roles she portrays. In 1991, Meg was offered the role of Clarice Starling in the box-office hit The Silence of the Lambs. However, she refused because she thought the movie was too gruesome and violent. The role eventually went to Jodie Foster.</p><p>She also turned down several notable film roles, including the leading roles in Washington Square, Steel Magnolias, Double Jeopardy, Basic Instinct, and Backdraft. There were also several close calls for Meg. She was set to star in To Die For, Housesitter, and Heartbreakers. However, she ended up leaving the production for various reasons.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibopqytbuNnKamZ52atG6%2B2JqlZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2agn6x6tLTEZpmem5Gism67zZ5kqJ5dnbytuNiwpqico2LEpq3LrZ%2BinaOpeqKv06ucrKuVqHw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmeg-ryan-net-worth-how-she-became-one-of-hollywoods-wealthiest-actresses.html&text=Meg%20Ryan%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20She%20Became%20One%20Of%20Hollywoods%20Wealthiest%20Actresses&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeg-ryan-net-worth-how-she-became-one-of-hollywoods-wealthiest-actresses.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeg-ryan-net-worth-how-she-became-one-of-hollywoods-wealthiest-actresses.html&title=Meg%20Ryan%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20She%20Became%20One%20Of%20Hollywoods%20Wealthiest%20Actresses" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmeg-ryan-net-worth-how-she-became-one-of-hollywoods-wealthiest-actresses.html&title=Meg%20Ryan%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20She%20Became%20One%20Of%20Hollywoods%20Wealthiest%20Actresses" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmeg-ryan-net-worth-how-she-became-one-of-hollywoods-wealthiest-actresses.html&title=Meg%20Ryan%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20She%20Became%20One%20Of%20Hollywoods%20Wealthiest%20Actresses" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeg-ryan-net-worth-how-she-became-one-of-hollywoods-wealthiest-actresses.html&description=Meg%20Ryan%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20She%20Became%20One%20Of%20Hollywoods%20Wealthiest%20Actresses" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-game-debuts-new-hairstyle-in-this-photo-he-is-slammed-for-stealing-nipsey-hussles-famous-look-332990.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Game Debuts New Hairstyle In This Photo  He Is Slammed For Stealing Nipsey Hussles Famous ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./corn-discards-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Corn discards">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
